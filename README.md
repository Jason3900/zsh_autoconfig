# zsh-autoconfig

## Description
A simple shell script to install oh-my-zsh with plugins and a simple configuration locally.

The script is mostly based on the official oh-my-zsh's install.sh, but users may have network problems when running on linux servers where internet connections are forbidden. Thus, I just make a copy of the official github repo and two useful plugins(autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting)' git repo and modified the script correspondingly to make it possible to install it offline.

By the way, I also disabled auto update and change the default theme to steeef, which is simple but more detailed.

## Usage
just git clone this project, then run install.sh (you may need make it executable before running it)
